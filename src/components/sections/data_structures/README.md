## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

`B` - Beginner, `A` - Advanced

* `B` [Linked List](readme_files/linked-list)
* `B` [Doubly Linked List](src/data-structures/doubly-linked-list)

* `B` [Stack](src/data-structures/stack)
* `B` [Hash Table](src/data-structures/hash-table)
* `B` [Heap](src/data-structures/heap) - max and min heap versions

### Big O Notation

*Big O notation* is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
On the chart below you may find most common orders of growth of algorithms specified in Big O notation.

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.
