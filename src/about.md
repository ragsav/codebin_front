Code>bin is completely frontend project developed in ReactJS.
The project is inspired by fact that most of the online tools do not provide 
step by step solution.



## Tech

Code>bin uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS](https://www.google.com) - Javascript framework by `facebook` for web apps!
- [Ace Editor](https://www.google.com) - awesome web-based text editor
- [React Bootstrap](https://www.google.com) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js](https://www.google.com) - evented I/O for the backend


And of course Code>bin itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/ragsav/codebin_frontend)
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

- Go to `src/constants/constants.js` and change the host to `localhost`
- Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd codebin
npm i
